A powerful C++ base/common lib.  


####  1. Description
---
**How many times you blame**, that why you can't use C++ just like java or python ?  
**How many times you blame**, that why does C++ forces you to do everything yourself ?  
even the basic operations like 'string split', 'file operations' over and over again?

**Now, you got one !** 

This part of code is a general infrastructure base/common lib for all projects.  
It offers you the basic operations with C++, wrap the functions which you can use everywhere, free you from coding the basic modules again and again.   


####  2. Platform
---
For now, most source code is based on GNU/linux.
